# ***Overview of the project***
This project aims at helping a biological researcher, who wants to discover and document Bacteria Species which are not yet well studies and some of them remain unknown to science, for the samples collected from the belly buttons of people across a country.

Primary objective of the project is to present the demographic information of a selected participant ID from a dropdown with the following results:
- Top 10 Bacteria Cultures found in the participant's sample
- How many times that person washes his/her belly button on a weekly basis
- Which bacteria specie groups are found in the sample of this particular individual in the what varying amounts;

## **Web-page is built using**
- HTML,CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript with library Plotly.js

## **Results**
This is an interactive dashboard which displays three visualizations to display the results of the lab test of every sample taken from a person's belly button. Here , a person is selected from a dropdown menu, which contains IDs of the individuals who participated in the research and provided samples from their belly buttons. 

All the charts are interactive. They display data for every 'TEST SUBJECT ID' in the runtime.

## **Summary**
An interactive dashboard to display the bio-diversity of belly button of each individual participant whose ID is selected from the dropdown and the resultant values for that individual are displayed to provide three insights in the form of these visualizations using a bar chart , gauge and bubble chart.
